# Vidly client - React.js

## Customers page
Create a customers page for the admin to manage customers.
Create all the necessary components:
- customerService
- customers page
- customerForm
- customersTable
- update vidly server app - customer model needs to be updated otherwise we cannot save or update a customer

TODO: 
Pagination component needs improvment - if there are many pages we need Previous and Next buttons and then show only few page numbers.

Customers page - make a selector for the search input. Now it searches the last_name by default.
